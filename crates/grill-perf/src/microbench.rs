//! Kernel and collective microbenchmark evidence (#54).
//!
//! HTTP output speed cannot prove that an isolated kernel or collective
//! changed, so this module keeps kernel/fabric observations in their own
//! closed artifact family. Three provenance states are distinct and never
//! silently upgraded:
//!
//! * `declared` — an operator statement with no measurement bytes. A declared
//!   artifact carries no samples and is rejected as measurement evidence.
//! * `imported` — bytes this collector parsed but did not produce. Importing
//!   always records `imported`, even when the payload claims native execution,
//!   and the payload's own claim is retained separately for audit.
//! * `native_observed` — bytes produced by a program this collector launched,
//!   or by the in-process CPU reference below. This records *observation*,
//!   never authenticated execution: the collector cannot attest what a child
//!   process actually did, and every runtime pin it retains is reported as an
//!   unauthenticated observation rather than as provenance.
//!
//! Only one adapter executes inside this binary: the deterministic CPU
//! `sum_u64` reference over the vector `0..bound`. It proves operation
//! recording, inspection and exact comparison, and it is the only adapter that
//! may be reported as native-observed under the current CPU-only
//! authorization. The EXL3 E3 grouped expert adapter and the NCCL all-reduce
//! adapter are explicitly launched programs; their device execution is a
//! separately authorized window and their artifacts stay unexercised until
//! then.
//!
//! Grounding for the two shipped device adapters, pinned before
//! implementation (hashes recorded in this file, in the plans under
//! `crates/grill-perf/examples/` and in `docs/performance/KERNEL-FABRIC.md`):
//!
//! * `MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks` at
//!   `f906ee990596486e10ddbe381efa6f0e496f77e3`:
//!   `tests/bench_e3_microbench.py` (operation and synthetic-routing source
//!   anchor) and `tests/test_exl3_overlay.py` (frozen parity tolerances).
//! * `NVIDIA/nccl-tests` `doc/PERFORMANCE.md` for the all-reduce byte
//!   definitions used by the reported bandwidth labels.
//!
//! Algorithmic payload bytes are `numel * sizeof(dtype)`. The factor
//! `2*(world-1)/world` is the nccl-tests *bus bandwidth* normalization for
//! all-reduce; it is labelled separately and is not measured physical link
//! traffic. A kernel or collective result never sets a serving-speed claim.
//!
//! Clocks and samples. Every artifact carries exactly one clock identity, kind,
//! unit, declared resolution and synchronization contract, and the plan must
//! declare the identical contract. A retained sample is the timer's own
//! decimal representation (`raw`) plus the exact rational nanosecond duration
//! converted from it, including scientific notation and fractional
//! nanoseconds. The declared clock resolution states the advertised timer
//! class; it never rounds, quantizes or gates a retained value, and a
//! sub-resolution digit is preserved rather than rejected. Every decision is
//! exact rational arithmetic — there is no floating-point decision path.
//!
//! Study shape. A native domain comparison needs at least three complete
//! measured acquisitions in EACH of the A, B and A2 roles, prospectively
//! declared in a study document before any acquisition is recorded. Missing,
//! failed or unusable acquisitions are never replaced, filtered or dropped:
//! they withhold the comparison. Within one acquisition the statistic is the
//! exact mean of the measured samples, or for rank scope the exact mean of the
//! complete per-repetition maxima; roles are then compared by pooling the A/A2
//! acquisition statistics into a reference envelope against the B envelope.
